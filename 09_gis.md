# GIS (Geographical Information Systems)

Class during these days will be led by Carolyn Talmadge of the Tufts DataLab.

These classes will introduce you to GIS software and applications. We will be using [ArcGIS](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview), a commercial platform that Tufts makes available through an [online interface](https://access.tufts.edu/arcgis). 

You might also be interested in [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org), a free and open-source platform for organizing and analyzing spatial information — the beating heart of any GIS application.

QGIS provides a [Python API](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/), but we'll just be focusing on the main application for now — hence why this is a plain Markdown file and not a Jupyter notebook.

If you want to get a head-start, follow the tutorial in the QGIS [documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/introducing_gis.html).
