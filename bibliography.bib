  abstract = {Contrary perhaps to expectation, Classical studies is at the vanguard of the latest technological developments for using digital tools and computational techniques in research. This article outlines its pioneering adoption of digital tools and methods, and investigates how the digital medium is helping to transform the study of Greek and Latin literature. It discusses the processes and consequences of digitization, explaining how technologies like multispectral imaging are increasing the textual corpus, while examining how annotation, engagement, and reuse are changing the way we think about “the text”. It also considers how the digital turn is reinvigorating textual analysis, by exploring the broader ecosystem, within which the digital text can now be studied, and which provides enriched contexts for understanding that are constantly shifting and expanding. Classical literature in the digital age has the potential to both challenge dominant modes of thinking about antiquity and disrupt traditional ways of doing research.},

While student numbers have grown in higher education, universities and colleges increasingly have encouraged students to opt for courses in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) or take programs in applied subjects like business and management. When tertiary learning has taken such a notably utilitarian turn, the humanities are judged to have lost their centrality. Willem B. Drees has no wish nostalgically to prioritize the humanities so as to retrieve some lost high culture. But he does urge us to adopt a clearer conception of the humanities as more than just practical vehicles for profit or education. He argues that these disciplines, while serving society, are also intrinsic to our humanity. His bold ideas about how to think with greater humanistic coherence mark this topical book out as unmissable reading for all those involved in academe, especially those in higher educational policy or leadership positions.},

  abstract = {We have built a suite of tools in Python to proficiently analyze text reuse and intertextuality for a specific kind of set of medieval Arabic texts (commentaries) available in print. We take these printed editions, scan them, pre-process the images, give it to an OCR engine, clean the results, and store it in a data structure that mimics the explicit intertextual relation the texts have, and continue to perform data analysis on it. Digital approaches to medieval Arabic texts have either been at the micro-level in what has become known as a ‘digital edition’, i.e.~the digital representation of one text, densely annotated, most commonly in TEI-XML, or it has been done at the macro-level in what is called a ‘digital corpus’, consisting of thousands of loosely encoded and sparsely annotated plain text files, accompanied by an entire infrastructure and high-performing software to perform broadly scoped queries. The micro-level generally is at the level of tens of thousands of words while the macro-level can be at the level of over a billion words. The micro-level is explicitly designed to be human readable first, while the macro-level is built to be machine readable first. At the micro-level, every little detail needs to be correct and in order, while at the macro-level a fairly large margin of error is still negligible as a mere rounding error. Amidst these levels we have been seeking a meso-level of digital analysis: neither edition nor corpus, but rather a group of texts at the level of hundreds of thousands to millions of words, with a small but perceptible margin of error, and a light but noticeable level of annotations, principally geared towards machine readability, but with ample opportunity for visual inspection and manual correction. In this paper we explain the rationale for our approach, the technical achievements it has led us to, and the results we so far obtained.},
